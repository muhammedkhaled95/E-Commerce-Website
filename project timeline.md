# Project Timeline

The timeline for delivering a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** for an e-commerce website using **FastAPI** depends on the complexity of features and the available resources (like frontend frameworks, integrations, and design). Below is a rough timeline that you can use as a guideline, which can be customized based on your specific project scope:

## **1. Requirements Gathering & Planning (1 week)**

- Finalize project scope with client (key features, design, and integrations).
- Set up project management tools (Trello, Jira, etc.).
- Prepare a detailed technical specification document (API architecture, database schema).
- Plan timelines and set deliverable milestones.

## **2. Design Phase (1–2 weeks)**

- **Wireframes**: Create wireframes for key pages (home, product, cart, checkout, etc.).
- **UI/UX Design**: If the client has a designer, this process might already be ongoing. Otherwise, collaborate to design the website.
- Finalize design elements such as branding, color schemes, typography, and responsiveness.

## **3. Backend Development (2–3 weeks)**

- **FastAPI Setup**: Set up FastAPI with appropriate project structure.
- **Database Setup**: Choose the database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) and design the schema for products, orders, users, etc.
- **User Authentication**: Implement basic user registration, login, and session management (OAuth for social login if required).
- **API Endpoints**: Develop core API endpoints for product catalog, user management, cart, and checkout.
- **Payment Integration**: Integrate payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) for processing transactions.

## **4. Frontend Development (2–3 weeks)**

- **Basic Pages**: Implement core pages (Homepage, Product Listings, Product Details, Cart, Checkout).
- **Frontend Framework**: If using a frontend framework like React, Vue, or Angular, set it up and connect it to FastAPI's endpoints.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure mobile-friendly design is implemented.
- **Initial Testing**: Test the frontend against your API endpoints for functionality.

## **5. Testing & Bug Fixing (1 week)**

- **Basic Functionality Testing**: Test all core features: browsing, adding to cart, checkout, payment, and user authentication.
- **Security Testing**: Ensure the MVP is secure, especially for user data and payment handling.
- **Performance Testing**: Run basic performance tests to ensure the MVP is scalable for initial user traffic.

## **6. MVP Launch & Feedback (1 week)**

- **Deploy to Staging**: Deploy the MVP on a staging server or testing environment.
- **Client Review & Beta Testing**: Allow the client and a small group of users to test the site and give feedback.
- **Bug Fixes & Refinements**: Address any critical issues or requests before final deployment.

---

## **Estimated Total Time for MVP**: **6–8 weeks**

### Milestone Breakdown

- **Week 1-2**: Planning and Design Finalization.
- **Week 3-5**: Backend and Frontend Development.
- **Week 6**: Testing and Bug Fixing.
- **Week 7-8**: Deployment, Client Review, and MVP Launch.

---

This timeline assumes:

- The project has standard e-commerce features.
- No unexpected complexities arise (e.g., third-party API issues).
- Reasonable turnaround times for client feedback.

If there are additional complexities like multi-vendor support, custom shipping methods, or heavy integrations (ERP, advanced inventory management), the timeline could extend by 2-4 weeks.
